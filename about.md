I'm Edil Medeiros, an Associate Professor at the University of Brasilia. 
Please check my [resumé](../assets/cv/20230824-curriculo-cv-resume-english.pdf) ([portuguese version](../assets/cv/20230824-curriculo-cv-resume-ptbr.pdf)) or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseedil/) if you are interested in my professional background. 
You may also find academic directed information on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6529-0780), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uwoh_14AAAAJ&hl=en) profiles, or at the [Lattes Platform](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2307490672260330) (the Brazilian academic CV database).

I've been working on two main research fronts: 

- techniques for compressing [point cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) geometry information;

I contribute to the [SilhouetteCoder](https://github.com/pointcloud-unb) project, a point cloud geometry codec based on the dyadic decomposition technique we developed at the University of Brasília. 
The lossless codec runs in C++ and we achieve state of the art compression efficiency. 
We have intra and inter versions of the coder, as well as a lossy version of it. 

- model-based design methodologies for embedded systems, inpired on functional programming concepts.

I contributed to the [ForSyDe](https://forsyde.github.io/) project led by Prof. Ingo Sander at the KTH Institute of Technology in Sweden. 
ForSyDe is a design methodology with a formal basis for modeling and design of heterogeneous systems-on-chip and cyber-physical systems.
More recently, me and [Eduardo Lemos](https://duing.dev/) have been working on [FACT](https://github.com/FP-Modeling), a domain-specific language based on a functional algebra for continuous time modeling.

Please check my [list of publications](../academic-publications.html) to find specific scientific contributions.

I have a background in semiconductor design and have contributed with circuit design and system-level modeling to systems on chip (SoC) for precision agriculture applications and with the design and verification of [hardware random-number generators (HRNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator) and [physical unclonable function (PUF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_unclonable_function) circuits for security applications. 
In 2014, I co-founded DFChip, a design house based on Brasília specialized in low-power analog power management intellectual property (IP) modules. 
I left the business in 2017.

I'm personally interested in economics, law, politics, ethics, and philosophy. 
In 2014, I co-founded the Liberal Institute of the Center-West (ILCO), a non-profit organization with the mission of spreading classical liberalism ideas among Brazilian university centers. 
In 2019, I co-founded the [Brasília chapter of the Leadership Development Institute](https://www.instagram.com/iflbsb/) (IFL BSB), a non-profit that runs a training cycle on classical liberalism, business management, and entrepreneurship. 
I regularly write for the [Libearl Institute](https://www.institutoliberal.org.br/) website and other Brazilian classical liberal venues.
Please check my [list of non academic publications](../other-publications.html) to learn my viewpoint about social organization and cooperation.
