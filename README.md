# Edil Medeiros Website

There's a `new-site` branch where the development takes place. 
When something is commited to the `main` branch, an action publishes the website using Github Pages to a custom domain `edil.com.br`.

The website is built with Jekyll and a customized version of the [Avenco](https://avenco.netlify.app) theme.
